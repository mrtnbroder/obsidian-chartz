# Polar Area Chart

## Example

````yaml
```chart
type: polarArea
labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
series:
    - title: Title 1
    data: [1,2,3,4,5]
    - title: Title 2
    data: [5,4,3,2,1]
labelColors: true
width: 40%
```
````

The above example Code will render a _Polar Area Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise. The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time. ![Polar Area Chart Example Image](https://github.com/mrtnbroder/obsidian-chartz/raw/master/images/polarareachart.png)
